## Introduction 
### What is 'Snowball'?

Snowball options, similar in nature to exotic options with barrier clauses, are unique financial instruments featuring knock-out and knock-in conditions. They are named for their similarity to a rolling snowball, where the conditions for the option's returns cna accumulate or 'snowball' under certain conditions. The idea is that as a snowball rolls down a hill, it can either grow larger, or it might hit a bump that causes it to break apart, or it could roll into a hole. The final outcome for the investor—much like the path of a snowball on a hillside—is uncertain and depends on whether these 'barrier' events occur during the life of the financial product. 

Financially, this translates into specific scenarios: if the price of the underlying asset rises to a certain level (knock-out price), the snowball product terminates early, and the investor receives a fixed return for the duration of the investment. If the price of the underlying asset falls to a certain level (knock-in price), then the profit or loss will be determined based on the underlying asset's price on the expiration date, and the investor may bear the risk of the underlying asset's price falling. If the underlying asset never touches the knock-in or knock-out price, the investor receives a fixed return for the entire duration of the product.
